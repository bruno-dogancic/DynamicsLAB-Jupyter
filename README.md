📚 DynamicsLab Jupyter: Learn Structural Vibrations Through Interactive Play:

An open educational resource (OER) for exploring MDOF systems in mechanical/civil engineering:

  * 🖱️ Drag-and-drop setup of lumped-mass models

  * 🎮 Interactive parameter tuning (stiffness, damping, forcing functions)

  * 📽️ Animated mode shapes and time-history responses

  * 📦 Example library: Shear buildings, vehicle suspensions, 2D frames

  * 📝 Export results to LaTeX/MATLAB for academic reports

  * 📈 Real-time vibration mode visualization

  * 🧪 Built-in solvers for free/forced responses (Runge-Kutta, Newmark-β)

  * 🛠️ Customizable mass-spring-damper networks with GUI widgets

  * 📊 Automated modal analysis (natural frequencies, damping ratios)

  * 🎓 Academic use cases: Seismic response, rotating machinery, structural dynamics

Designed to bridge theory and computation in vibration analysis courses.
